I am currently a third-year master's student in Computer Science and Technology at the School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, under the supervision of [Chuang Hu](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/info/1019/2480.htm) and [Dazhao Cheng](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/info/1019/2504.htm). I obtained my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from the same school. My research interests include efficient AI and edge AI.
